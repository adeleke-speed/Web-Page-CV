                        <p>A Software that can calculate the shielding thickness of a 6 MV LINAC — Abstract:
                        shielding is highly paramount for protection against ionizing radiation, 
                        and to ensure standard shielding of the bunker, rigorous calculations have to be made. 
                        This LINAC shielding software program is designed to provide quick and accurate calculation 
                        required for shielding radiotherapy bunker housing of 6 MV linear accelerator. 
                        Making use of the values entered by the user and various parameters, the program is able to calculate: 
                        machine workload, primary barrier thickness, secondary barrier thickness, dose rate at maze entrance. 
                        The purpose of this work is to compare the calculations performed by this program to the calculations 
                        suggested in the IAEA document on Radiation Protection in the Design of Radiotherapy Facilities, 
                        Safety Report Series No. 47 on 6 MV Linear Accelerator Facility for primary barrier, 
                        secondary barrier and dose rate at maze entrance. This software succeeds in providing 
                        timely and accurate calculations of required barrier thickness.
