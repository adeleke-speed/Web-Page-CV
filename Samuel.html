                            <p>A Software that can calculate the shielding thickness of a 6 MV LINAC — Abstract:
                               <br> shielding is highly paramount for protection against ionizing radiation, 
                               and to ensure standard <br> shielding of the bunker, rigorous calculations have to be made. 
                               This LINAC shielding <br> software program is designed to provide quick and accurate calculation 
                               required for <br> shielding radiotherapy bunker housing of 6 MV linear accelerator. 
                               <br> Making use of the values entered by the user and various parameters, the program is <br> able to calculate: 
                               machine workload, primary barrier thickness, secondary barrier thickness, <br> dose rate at maze entrance. 
                               The purpose of this work is to compare the calculations performed <br> by this program to the calculations 
                               suggested in the IAEA document on Radiation Protection <br>in the Design of Radiotherapy Facilities, 
                               Safety Report Series No. 47 on 6 MV Linear Accelerator <br> Facility for primary barrier, 
                               secondary barrier and dose rate at maze entrance. This software <br> succeeds in providing 
                               timely and accurate calculations of required barrier thickness.</p>
